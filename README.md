-Files (hd) recovery with TestDisk and Photorec

</br>

This is a bash script that:

Searches all recup_dir.* folders from the PhotoRec recovery,

Organizes valuable files by type (documents, images, keys, databases, Music, Other.),

Copies them to a structured folder under ~/Recovered,

Skips duplicates (-n option in cp),

Logs everything for review.
